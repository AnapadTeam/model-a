The computer keyboard and mouse has been the predominant hardware interface for desktop computers for over six decades. Technology has progressed dramatically over the years, but the way we interface with computers has largely remained the same. We envision a new kind of hardware interface that synthesizes the functionality of the keyboard and mouse into a single device. The device will consist of a multicolor, multitouch display mounted in a housing that approximates the footprint of a traditional keyboard. As we imagine how to innovate the desktop environment for greater productivity, intuition, and satisfaction, the aim of our device is to provide a more efficient, seamless, and enjoyable user experience. We call this product an anapad.
This repository contains the source code and project files for Model A, the first anapad ever created.
